📔 RESEARCH LOG: PROJECT NEURAL-BYPASSSubject: Forced Implementation of On-Device LLM (Gemini Nano) on Sub-Optimal HardwareDate: November 21, 2025Researcher: [Your Name]1. THE OBJECTIVETo achieve "Air-Gapped" (Offline) AI inference capabilities within a web browser environment, enabling secure code generation and automation without sending data to cloud servers.2. SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS & REQUIREMENTSThe primary challenge was overcoming the hard-coded restrictions in the Chromium engine.ParameterOfficial RequirementMy System (The Constraint)StatusGPU VRAMMinimum 3 GB dedicated1.9 GB (Integrated/Low-End)❌ FAILEDStorage> 22 GB Free Space172 GB Free Space✅ PASSEDRegionUS / Select CountriesIndia (IN)❌ BLOCKEDBrowserChrome Canary/DevChrome Dev v133+⚠️ VOLATILENetworkUnmetered Wi-FiStandard Wi-Fi✅ PASSED3. THE TECHNICAL BARRIERSHardware Lock: Chrome automatically aborts the model download if VRAM < 3GB.Geo-Block: Download servers reject requests from non-US IP addresses.API Deprecation: The standard window.ai documentation is obsolete in v133+ builds; the namespace has shifted to LanguageModel.4. THE ENGINEERED SOLUTION (Methodology)A. The Hardware Override (Command Injection)To bypass the VRAM check, the standard browser shortcut was modified to inject specific feature flags at runtime.Code: --enable-features=PromptAPIForGeminiNano,OptimizationGuideOnDeviceModel:compatible_on_device_performance_classes/*,OptimizationGuideOnDeviceModelOverrideNote: The * wildcard forces compatibility with ALL hardware classes. The Override tag prevents the "Install Not Complete" error on low VRAM.B. The Region SpoofingBrowser Level: Display Language set strictly to English (United States).Network Level: VPN tunneling to US-West during the initial 1.5GB payload acquisition.C. API Interface (The "Bridge")The standard window.ai.createTextSession() failed due to version mismatch.Discovery: Detected hidden global class LanguageModel.Implementation: Constructed a custom asynchronous handler to stream "deltas" (chunks) of text rather than full replacements, solving the "jumping text" UI glitch.5. FINAL CONFIGURATIONModel Version: 2025.8.21.1028 (1.5 Billion Parameters).Interface: Custom HTML5 Dashboard ("Offline Architect").Latency: 0ms Network / ~30s Cold Start / Instant Token Generation.🐙 GitHub Repository PlanSince you are making this public to help friends, here is how you should structure the repo.Repo Name Ideas:Chrome-Nano-UnlockerLow-Spec-Local-AIProject-Offline-ArchitectFile Structure:Plaintext📂 Chrome-Nano-Unlocker/

What to put in the README.md (The Guide):I have written the "About" section for you. You can paste this right into your GitHub:## About This ProjectThis repository provides a method to run Google's Gemini Nano AI locally and offline in Chrome, specifically optimized for low-end laptops (under 3GB VRAM) and restricted regions (outside the US).## Why use this?Privacy: Your code/prompts never leave your laptop.Zero Latency: Works without internet.Free: No API keys required.## The "Magic" CommandTo bypass the GPU requirements, you must launch Chrome with these flags:chrome.exe --enable-features=PromptAPIForGeminiNano,OptimizationGuideOnDeviceModel:compatible_on_device_performance_classes/*,OptimizationGuideOnDeviceModelOverride
